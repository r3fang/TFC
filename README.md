##Introduction

**TFC** is a *precise*, *lightweight*, *fast*, *stand-alone*, *C-implemented* and *mapping-free* Bioinformatics software designed for **fusion detection** by pair-end RNA-seq data. TFC has two modes, **rapid** and **predict**. **rapid** mode only asks users for two .fastq files and predicts against a list of fixed gene candidates with fixed parameters settings. **predict** allows user to determine the gene candidates and all parameters.

## FAQ

 1. **How fast is TFC?**     
 On average, **~5min** per million pairs using a single x86_64 32-bit 2000 MHz GenuineIntel processor.   
 We tested TFC on 43 real RNA-seq data against 506 genes candidates. On average, TFC spends ~5min per million pairs. However, the running time is not absolutely linear to the number of reads. We found most of the time has been spent on the alignment for the step *fusion refinement* and *junction refinement*, therefore, the more fusions in the sample identified, the longer TFC usually runs. 

 2. **What's the maximum memory requirement for TFC?**   
 **1GB** would be enough for the **rapid** mode and predicting against 1,000 genes.   
 The majority (~90%) of the memory occupied by TFC is used for storing the kmer hash table indexed from reference sequences. Thus, the more genes are being tested, theoretically the more memory will be needed (also depends on the complexity of the sequences). Based on our simulations, predicting against ~1000 genes with k=15 always takes less than **1GB** memory, which means TFC can definately be used on most of today's PCs.

 3. **How precise is TFC?**  
 **~0.85** and **~0.99** for sensitivity and specificity on the simulated data.     
 We randomly constructed 50 fused transcripts and simulated Illumina pair-end sequencing reads from constructed transcripts using [art](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/) in paired-end mode with parameters setting as `-p -l 75 -ss HS25 -f 30 -m 200 -s 10` and run ```./tfc rapid``` against simulated reads, then calculate sensitivity and specificity. Repeat above process for 200 time and get the average sensitivity and specificity.

 4. **What are the genes being tested in the rapid mode?**  
 We have a list of 506 genes that have been found fused with other genes in the literature, those genes serve as a default gene set if user does not really know what genes should be tested. 

 5. **How many genes should I test each time?**  
 Let's make it clear, the more genes being tested, the more memory TFC will grasp. The relationship between number of tested genes (N) and memory usage is linear(R=0.99) when N<3000 as shown in the table below.
 
 | # of tested genes  | vmsize(GB) | vmpeak(GB) | vmrss(GB) | vmhwm(GB) |   
 |:------------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
 | 500  | 0.29	| 0.29	|0.28	| 0.28 |
 | 1000 | 0.57	| 0.57	|0.56	| 0.56 |
 | 1500 | 0.89	| 0.89	|0.88	| 0.88 |
 | 2000 | 1.19	| 1.19	|1.19	| 1.19 |
 | 2500 | 1.54	| 1.59	|1.53	| 1.58 |
 | 3000 | 1.89	| 1.89	|1.88	| 1.88 |
 
 6. **How is the likelihood of fusion calculated?**   
 Let Si, Sj be the set of reads that match with gene_i and gene_j respectively. S1_ij is a set of reads that support fusion e_ij and overlap with its junction. S2_ij is a set of reads that support fusion e_ij but not overlapping with its junction. f(s) indicates the alignment score of s against the real transcript of the fusion. Then the likelihood equals the product of alignment score of reads that support the fusion normalized by sequencing depth.

 7. **What's the null model for p-value?**   
 We extracted normal transcripts of targeted genes and simulated pair-end reads from the normal transcripts. Then run TFC against the simulated data and calculate the likelihood for every gene pair. Repeat this for 200 times and get the distribution of likelihood of every gene pair as the null model. 

 8. **How does TFC guarantee specificity without comparing sequencing reads against regions outside targeted genes?**   
 we have several strict criteria to filter out reads that are likely to come from regions outside targeted intervals. For instance, both ends of a pair are aligned against the constructed transcript and those pairs of any end not being successfully aligned will be discarded. Also, any pair with too large or too small insertion size will be filtered out. The likelihood of fusion will be normalized by sequencing depth of the two genes before p-value is calculated.

 9.  **Is there anything I should be very careful about for `./tfc name2fasta`?**    
 Yes, genes.gtf needs to be sorted by its 5th column, the end position of the feature.

 10. **Is there anything I should be very careful about for `./tfc predict`?**  
 Yes, before running `tfc predict [options] <exon.fa> <R1.fq> <R2.fq>`, user has to make sure R1.fq and R2.fq (RNA-seq) are in the right order that R2.fq must be identical to the psoitive strand of reference genome.
