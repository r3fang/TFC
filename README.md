##Introduction

**TFC** is a super *lightweight*, *stand-alone*, *ultrafast*, *C-implemented*, *mapping-free* and *sensitive* Bioinformatics software for **fusion detection** between candidate genes from RNA-seq data. It consists of two major components:
 
```
$ ./tfc 

Program: tfc (targeted fusion calling)
Version: 08.19-r15
Contact: Rongxin Fang <r3fang@ucsd.edu>

Usage:   tfc <command> [options]

Command: name2fasta     extract DNA sequences
         predict        predict gene fusions
```

- **name2fasta** 
  
> extract *exon/transcript/CDS* sequences of targeted genes. Before running it, .gtf file has to be sorted based on the 4th column by  
`sort -k5,5n genes.gtf > genes.sorted.gtf`
 
```
$./tfc name2fasta

Usage:   tfc name2fasta [options] <gname.txt> <genes.gtf> <in.fa> <out.fa> 

Details: name2fasta is to extract genomic sequence of gene candiates

Options: -g               'exon' or 'transcript' or 'CDS' 

Inputs:  gname.txt        .txt file contains the names of gene candiates
         genes.gtf        .gft file contains gene annotations sorted by 5th column
         in.fa            .fa file contains the whole genome sequence e.g. [hg19.fa]
         out.fa           .fa files contains output sequences
```

- **predict** 
  
> predict fusions between targeted genes. **IMPORTANT** before running it, you need to make sure R1.fq and R2.fq have their read's name matched up. Sort R1.fq and R2.fq based on id if necessary 
```
$ zcat R1.fq.gz | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -S 3G | tr '\t' '\n' | gzip > R1.sorted.fq.gz
$ zcat R2.fq.gz | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -S 3G | tr '\t' '\n' | gzip > R2.sorted.fq.gz
```

```
$ ./tfc predict

Usage:   tfc predict [options] <exon.fa> <R1.fq.gz> <R2.fq.gz>

Details: predict gene fusion from pair-end RNA-seq data

         -j INT    penality for jump between genes [-10]
         -s INT    penality for jump between exons [-8]
         -a FLOAT  min identity score for alignment [0.80]
   -- Junction:
         -h INT    min hits for a junction [3]
         -l INT    length for junction string [20]
         -x INT    max mismatches allowed for junction string match [2]
   -- Fusion:
         -A INT    weight for junction containing reads [3]
         -p FLOAT  p-value cutoff for fusions [0.05]

Inputs:  exon.fa   .fasta file that contains exon sequences of 
                   targeted genes, which can be generated by: 
                   tfc name2fasta <gname.txt> <genes.gtf> <in.fa> <exon.fa>  
         R1.fq.gz  5'->3' end of pair-end sequencing reads
         R2.fq.gz  the other end of sequencing reads
```

## FAQ

 1. **How fast is TFC?**   
 TFC is 100% implemented in C. We tested TCF (predict) on 43 different targeted RNA-seq data sets with various number of reads ranging from 0.9m to 20m against 506 targeted genes, here is the running time. On average, TFC runs 6min per sample.   
 
  |Sample         | Reads Number   | Running Time |
  |:-------------:| :-------------:| :-------------:|
  |1       | 10M            | 6min         |
  |2  | 5M             | 5min         |
  |3              | 0.4M           | 5min         |
  |4              | 5M             | 5min         |
  |...            | ...            | ...          |
  |41             | 5M             | 5min         |
  |42             | 5M             | 5min         |
  |43             | 5M             | 5min         |  
  
 2. **What's the minimum memory requirement for TFC?**   
 **1G** would be the up limit for most of the cases.   
 The majority (~95%) of memory occupied by TFC is used to store the kmer hash table indexed from reference sequences. Thus, the more genes are being tested, probably the more memory will be needed (it also depends on the complexity of the sequences). Based on our tons of simulations, predicting ~500 genes with k=15 always takes less than **1GB** memory, which means you can definately run TFC on most of today's PCs.
 3. **Does TFC depend on any third-party software?**   
 No. TFC is compeletely stand-alone.
 4. **How precise is tfc?**  
 Based on our simulation, TFC is able to achieve <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%24%240.85%5Cpm0.04%24%24&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="$$0.85\pm0.04$$" width="100" height="17" /> for sensitivity and <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%24%240.99%5Cpm0.005%24%24&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="$$0.99\pm0.005$$" width="111" height="17" /> for specificity.  
 We randomly generated 50 fused transcripts and simulated illumina pair-end sequencing reads from fused transcripts using [art](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/) by command   
 `art_illumina -i transript.fa -p -l 75 -ss HS25 -f 30 -m 200 -s 10 -o paired_reads`   
 and run TFC on *paired_reads1.fq* and *paired_reads2.fq* then caculate Sensitivity and Specificity. Repeat above process for 100 time. 
 5. **How does TFC guarantee specificity when sequencing reads are only compared with the targeted genes?**   
 we have several strict criteria to filter out read pairs that are likely to come from regions outside targeted loci. For instance, both ends of a pair are aligned to the fused transcript and those pairs of any end not being aligned with a fair score will be discarded. Also, any pair with too large or too small insertion size will be filtered out. 
 6. **Does tfc work for single-end reads?**  
 Unfornately, TFC only works for pair-end sequencing data now, but have it also run for single-end read is a feature we would love to add in the near future.
 7. **Is there anything I should be very careful about?**  
 Yes, when you run `tfc predict [options] <exon.fa> <R1.fq> <R2.fq>`, R1.fq and R2.fq (RNA-seq) must be in the right order that R2.fq should be identical to the psoitive strand of reference genome. 
 8. **Does TFC support parallel computing?**    
 No. We realize TFC is fast enough for most cases, but this is a feature we would love to add in the near future.
